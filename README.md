# Lynx Wallet Integration
Integration TLOS DApp on Lynx Mobile Wallet using Lynx Native API

Currently there are scarce sample code how to integrate our smart contract with Lynx Mobile Wallet. This is my code sample how to run transcation on your smart contract in Lynx Wallet explorer.

But be carefull, this sample code interaction with Koin4DApp smart contract (Open, Transfer and Withdraw), please adjust the code before test.
